## Introduction
This project aims to build a novel Redash chat add-on that our team members can use to extract insight from multiple Redash dashboards and create SQL Queries from connected databases using natural language. The chat add-on enables a seamless  conversation in a question and answer format and autonomous knowledge discovery.  User queries could be about what is already displayed in the dashboard or questions that require generating SQL query using LLMs to be run against our connected databases. 
The Redash ChatGPT Plugin is an integration that brings natural language conversation capabilities powered by ChatGPT to your Redash dashboard. With this plugin, Redash users can engage in interactive and conversational queries, as well as visualize data directly from the chat interface.

## Features

* Conversational Queries: Users can interact with Redash using natural language queries, making the process more intuitive and user-friendly.
* Interactive Responses: ChatGPT generates human-like responses, providing users with informative and contextual feedback on their queries.
* Data Visualization: The plugin allows users to visualize query results directly within the chat interface, enabling faster data exploration and analysis.

`The Redash ChatGPT Plugin is an exciting project that aims to integrate natural language conversation capabilities powered by ChatGPT into your Redash dashboard. Although the plugin is still a work in progress, it currently provides functionality for engaging in conversational queries with ChatGPT directly within the Redash interface`
